# Prediction of Energy consumption
## Description:
*   The goal of this project is to predict the Energy consumption of electrical appliances based on temperature and humidity inside and outside the house together with general weather conditions as recorded near the airport (from Chievres weather station, Belgium) in Wh(Watt-hour).

## Libraries used:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* sklearn
* seaborn

## Content:
The data was collected in a duration of 10minutes for a duration of 4.5 months with the following attributes:-
* date           
* Appliances (energy use in Wh )  
* lights (energy use in Wh)       
* T1 (Temperature in kitchen area in Celsius)           
* RH_1 (Humidity in kitchen area in %)          
* T2 (Temperature in the living room in Celsius)         
* RH_2 (Humidity in the living room in %)      
* T3 (Temperature in laundry room area)
* RH_3 (Humidity in laundry room area, in % )        
* T4 (Temperature in office room, in Celsius )         
* RH_4 (Humidity in office room, in %)         
* T5  (Temperature in bathroom, in Celsius)         
* RH_5 (Humidity in bathroom, in % )      
* T6 (Temperature outside the building (north side), in Celsius)           
* RH_6  (Humidity outside the building (north side), in % )        
* T7 (Temperature in ironing room , in Celsius)         
* RH_7 (Humidity in ironing room, %)         
* T8 ( Temperature in teenager room 2, in Celsius)       
* RH_8  (Humidity in teenager room 2, in %)         
* T9 ( Temperature in parents room, in Celsius)            
* RH_9 (Humidity in parents room, in %)         
* T_out ( Temperature outside)        
* Press_mm_hg (Pressure in mm of mercury)  
* RH_out (Humidity outside)      
* Windspeed ( Windspeed in m/s)  
* Visibility (Visibility in km)   
* Tdewpoint (Dew point temperature in Â°C)    
* rv1(random variable 1)         
* rv2 ( random variable 2)
